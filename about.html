      <p><strong>Hey there! Iâ€™m Maanvik â€” and this is my summer story.</strong></p>

      <p>
        After months of school deadlines and responsibilities, summer is my time
        to explore, create, and make memories. This website is more than just a
        design project â€” itâ€™s a digital scrapbook of my summer experiences.
      </p>

      <h3>ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of This Website</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Share my personal summer adventures and milestones</li>
        <li>Reignite creativity through web design and development</li>
        <li>Showcase portfolio-ready HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills</li>
        <li>Capture the essence of summer with vibrant visuals and interactivity</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>ðŸŒ… My Summer Inspiration</h3>
      <p>
        This year, my summer was filled with <em>incredible</em> experiences â€”
        from hanging out with friends at SkyZone and Arrowhead, to paintball battles, movie nights, and an unforgettable trip to Wyoming.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also took big steps in my personal growth â€” working at a community center, attending FBLA Nationals (and winning my event!), and interning at ASU in the field of Electrical & Computer Engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        These moments â€” the laughter, the challenges, the sunsets â€” inspired every element of this site, from the warm color palette to the playful animations.
      </p>

      <p class="closing-line">
        Thanks for visiting! I hope this site makes you feel the same joy and excitement that summer brings me. ðŸŒ´
